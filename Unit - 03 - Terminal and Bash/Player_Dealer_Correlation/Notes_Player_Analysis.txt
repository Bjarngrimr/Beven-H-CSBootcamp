Step 3;Player Analysis 

1. using grep -i - 0310_win_loss_player_data 0312_win_loss_player_data 0315_win_loss_player_data > Roulette_losses i have determined all the days there were losses for lucky duck

2. using sed -e 's/    */\t/g' Roulette_Losses | awk -F"[\t]" '{print $1,$3}' Displays the Following Data:

0310_win_loss_player_data:05:00:00 AM Amirah Schneider,Nola Portillo, Mylie Schmidt,Suhayb Maguire,Millicent Betts,Avi Graves 
0310_win_loss_player_data:08:00:00 AM Chanelle Tapia, Shelley Dodson , Valentino Smith, Mylie Schmidt 
0310_win_loss_player_data:02:00:00 PM Jaden Clarkson, Kaidan Sheridan, Mylie Schmidt  
0310_win_loss_player_data:08:00:00 PM Mylie Schmidt, Trixie Velasquez, Jerome Klein ,Rahma Buckley 
0310_win_loss_player_data:11:00:00 PM Mcfadden Wasim, Norman Cooper, Mylie Schmidt 
0312_win_loss_player_data:05:00:00 AM Montana Kirk, Alysia Goodman, Halima Little, Etienne Brady, Mylie Schmidt 
0312_win_loss_player_data:08:00:00 AM Rimsha Gardiner,Fern Cleveland, Mylie Schmidt,Kobe Higgins 
0312_win_loss_player_data:02:00:00 PM Mae Hail, Mylie Schmidt,Ayden Beil
0312_win_loss_player_data:08:00:00 PM Tallulah Rawlings,Josie Dawe, Mylie Schmidt,Hakim Stott, Esther Callaghan, Ciaron Villanueva 
0312_win_loss_player_data:11:00:00 PM Vlad Hatfield,Kerys Frazier,Mya Butler, Mylie Schmidt,Lex Oakley,Elin Wormald 
0315_win_loss_player_data:05:00:00 AM Arjan Guzman,Sommer Mann, Mylie Schmidt 
0315_win_loss_player_data:08:00:00 AM Lilianna Devlin,Brendan Lester, Mylie Schmidt,Blade Robertson,Derrick Schroeder 
0315_win_loss_player_data:02:00:00 PM Mylie Schmidt, Corey Huffman 

then Using sed -e 's/\s/\n/g' < Roulette_Losses | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head  -2 we get :

     64 
     13 Mylie

therefore determining the Mylie has been in all 13 games where loss has occured.


the code to find the number was researched online and found at: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/41479/find-n-most-frequent-words-in-a-file 
with a minor tweek to get my result that i wanted.
