using the following Code we can see who is working the roulette table for specific days and times:

echo -n "$date - " >> Dealers_working_during_losses | sed 's/:00:00 //' $date_Dealer_schedule | grep -iE $time | awk -F'[\t]' '{print $1,$3}' >> Dealers_working_during_losses

                $date is the 4 digit date code for the file eg. 0310
                $time is the time and either am or pm eg. 05am



All loss days and Dealers for Roulette:

0310 05am - Dealer is Billy Jones
0310 08am - Dealer is Billy Jones
0310 02pm - Dealer is Billy Jones
0310 08pm - Dealer is Billy Jones
0310 11pm - Dealer is Billy Jones
0312 05am - Dealer is Billy Jones
0312 08am - Dealer is Billy Jones
0312 02pm - Dealer is Billy Jones
0312 08pm - Dealer is Billy Jones
0312 11pm - Dealer is Billy Jones
0315 05am - Dealer is Billy Jones
0315 08am - Dealer is Billy Jones
0315 02pm - Dealer is Billy Jones

and using the following code we can tell the most Common Player Across all loss days is Mylie Schmidt:

Look at Files Directly:   cat 0310_win_loss_player_data 0312_win_loss_player_data 0315_win_loss_player_data | grep - | sed -e 's/\s/\n/g' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head  -2

Move to a File First:     grep -i - 0310_win_loss_player_data 0312_win_loss_player_data 0315_win_loss_player_data > Roulette_losses
			  sed -e 's/\s/\n/g' < Roulette_Losses | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head  -2


In Conclusion, Mylie Schmidt and Billy Jones are working in conjunction to Scam Lucky Duck
