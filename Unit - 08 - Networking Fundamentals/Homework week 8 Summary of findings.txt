this is on OSI layer 7 : application layer

Phase 4 -----
packet no. 16 is a post request where a hacker has posted to Blues corp about the port 22 vunrability and is offering to give away the user and password to allow them to SSH into the system 
for monetary gain

DNS spoofing evidence is on packet 5 in the arp request and response, though this packet is based in 2014 where as the packet 16 is from 2019 so either the hacker is covering their tracks or
this incident is not related

OSI layer 7 : application layer -- for HTTP
ARP happens on OSI layer 2 : data link - for MAC address and also on Layer 3 : Network Layer for IP
