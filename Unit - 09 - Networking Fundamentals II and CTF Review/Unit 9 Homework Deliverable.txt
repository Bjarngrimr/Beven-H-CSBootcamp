DNS type - Mail exchange (MX)
By typing nslookup -type=mx starwars.com we get the following;
    Server:		8.8.8.8
    Address:	8.8.8.8#53

    Non-authoritative answer:
    starwars.com	mail exchanger = 1 aspmx.l.google.com.
    starwars.com	mail exchanger = 5 alt2.aspmx.l.google.com.
    starwars.com	mail exchanger = 5 alt1.aspx.l.google.com.
    starwars.com	mail exchanger = 10 aspmx3.googlemail.com.
    starwars.com	mail exchanger = 10 aspmx2.googlemail.com.
The main issue here is that the Mail exchanger is wrong or outdated and needs to be updated

The correct way it should be set up is as follows;
    starwars.com    mail exchanger = 1 asltx.l.google.com   (this is a Primary address) 
    starwars.com    mail exchanger = 5 asltx.2.google.com   (this is a secondary address)

By typing nslookup -type=txt theforce.net we get the following;
    Server:		8.8.8.8
    Address:	8.8.8.8#53

    Non-authoritative answer:
    theforce.net	text = "google-site-verification=ycgY7mtk2oUZMagcffhFL_Qaf8Lc9tMRkZZSuig0d6w"
    theforce.net	text = "v=spf1 a mx mx:smtp.secureserver.net include:aspmx.googlemail.com ip4:104.156.250.80 ip4:45.63.15.159 ip4:45.63.4.215"
    theforce.net	text = "google-site-verification=XTU_We07Cux-6WCSOItl0c_WS29hzo92jPE341ckbOQ"

The main issue is that on the second line that begins wuth "v=spf1" we can see a list of IPs but the new updated IP is not on this list.

To fix this the second line should read as follows
    theforce.net	text = "v=spf1 a mx mx:smtp.secureserver.net include:aspmx.googlemail.com ip4:104.156.250.80 ip4:45.63.15.159 ip4:45.63.4.215 ip4:45.23.176.21"

By typing nslookup -type=CNAME www.theforce.net we get the following;
    Server:		8.8.8.8
    Address:	8.8.8.8#53

    Non-authoritative answer:
    www.theforce.net	canonical name = theforce.net.

The Issue here is that there is no record for resistance.theforce.net

to fix this, the record should be changed to;
    Non-authoritative answer:
    www.theforce.net	canonical name = theforce.net.
    theforce.net    canonical name = resistance.theforce.net

By typing nslookup -type=NS princessleia.site we get the following;
    Server:		8.8.8.8
    Address:	8.8.8.8#53

    Non-authoritative answer:
    princessleia.site	nameserver = ns25.domaincontrol.com.
    princessleia.site	nameserver = ns26.domaincontrol.com.

To solve the issue and allow access in the event of a SITH attack we simply need to add the backup DNS as follows;
        Non-authoritative answer:
        princessleia.site	nameserver = ns25.domaincontrol.com.
        princessleia.site	nameserver = ns26.domaincontrol.com.
        princessleia.site	nameserver = ns2.galaxybackup.com.
